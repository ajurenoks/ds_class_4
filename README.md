# Lecture on Binary Search Trees (BST)

In this lecture, we explored the data structure known as a binary search tree (BST). The beginning of the lecture focused on the conceptual framework and fundamental principles of BSTs, which allow for the efficient organization and management of data. As the lecture progressed, practical examples were discussed, demonstrating how to construct such data structures and their advantages compared to other data structures.

Special attention was given to methods of adding elements and search operations within the context of BSTs. Specific code examples were shown to illustrate how to insert elements and efficiently find the necessary elements within the structure. The lecture also covered various BST variations and their applications in solving different problems, providing a clear understanding of why and in which situations this data structure is advantageous.

On the GitHub site, three example files have been added:
- `example_1.py` – An example of creating a data structure
- `example_2.py` – An example of adding an element to the BST data structure
- `example_3.py` – An example of searching for an element in the BST data structure
